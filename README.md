Keep in mind that while Cryper does most things better than other tools, it's not a one-size-fits-all and doesn't try to be. There are use cases such as full-disk encryption where VeraCrypt and BitLocker would be a better choice. So while Cryper is a great choice for the majority of people, you should still do your own research and use what's best for you.
